                <h2>The 20 Best Simple Website Examples</h2>
                <p>Ready to dive right into our favorite simple website examples? We've pulled websites from several industries with various purposes to show that you can build a simple website that gets visitors' notice no matter what industry you're designing for.</p>
                <div class="divisions">
                <span class="headings">1.<a href="#" class="p-name">Ollivere</a></span>
                <img src="img/simple-website-examples-ollivere-jpg.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>When you land on Ollivere's website, the company immediately introduces you to its mission: "Great design. No nonsense." 
                    Keeping the homepage simple aside from mindfully placed copy makes visitors want to learn more about the brand's story
                    . As you scroll down, <a href="#" class="p-name">parallax scrolling</a> further brings that story to life with visually appealing sketches and compelling examples.</p>
                <p class="text"><span class="dark">What we like:</span> Ollivere demonstrates its commitment to producing great design without nonsense on its own straightforward
                yet eye-catching site.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="divisions">
                    <span class="headings">2.<a href="#" class="p-name">Ink</a></span>
                    <img src="img/simple-website-examples-ink-jpg.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>Ink's homepage is text-centric but is mindful of how much copy it uses. Instead of overwhelming visitors with a daunting
                    paragraph of text, Ink keeps its copy sparse and holds visitor interest.</p>
                    <p class="text"><span class="dark">What we like:</span> Ink places its menu in the form of a small dot in the top right-hand corner. 
                        Because of its clever placement, users can
                    infer this is the menu without using any text. This simple yet visually engaging website uses parallax scrolling
                    features to bring it to life.
                        </p>

                    <img src="img/simple-website-examples-the-shine-app-jpg.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>The Shine App's website opens with an image, a brief copy, and an acknowledgment of an award the company has won. When
                    you scroll down, the <a href="#" class="p-name">brand's signature colors</a> will meet you. The entire site is relaxing and easy to navigate, which
                    echoes the app's purpose.</p>
                    <p class="text"><span class="dark">What we like:</span> When you scroll down on the homepage, 
                        The Shine App offers a demo of what the app looks like when you download it onto
                    your cell phone.

                    <img src="img/simple-website-examples-nate-smith-jpg.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>The Nate Smith website is unique because it features a mobile phone-looking animation. When you click through, the phone
                    changes into a computer. We love the parallax scrolling feature this site uses.</p>
                    <p class="text"><span class="dark">What we like:</span>Nate Smith's site features sparse but effective copy.
